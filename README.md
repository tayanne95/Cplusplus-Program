## WilcoxProject6 - CS210
*Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.* <br />
This project utilizes a menu accepting user input to display a list of purchased grocery items from a text file and can perform various actions including 
displayning a list of all items and counts, a list of an item which the user selects and the number of times the item was purchased, and finally
displaying a text-based histogram of the count of items purchased.

<br />
*What did you do particularly well?* <br />
I feel that I was able to effectively address the tasks using clear and understandable code.

<br />
*Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?* <br />
My code lacks formatting and could be more clear and usable, less susceptible to breaking, but including some additional checks of input and formatting rules.

<br />
*Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?*<br />
Writing to the file was most complex for me and I found some useful resources online to aid in this process. I was able to open the file and the utilize a loop to write the file.

<br />
*What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?*<br />
This project increased my ability to use 2 different languges to create an effective program, highlighting the ability to select which language can best perform a task.
As programs increase in complexity, this ability will prove useful in additional programming courses and business-applications.

<br />
*How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?*<br />
With the use of relative pathways, each python function can be reused for a variety of input files to perform each menu item. This allows one to utilize functions many times
over and could be adapted further to accept user input so the program knows which in or out file to use.
